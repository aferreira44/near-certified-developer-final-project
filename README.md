# NEAR Certified Developer

## Smart contract suggestions:

- You are suggested to create a smart contract (back-end) + dApp (front end)
- The contract should be deployed to NEAR TestNet. You should be able to make calls to your contract
- The contract should use all of the following features of NEAR Protocol: Storage, Context, Persistent Collections, assert statements / unit tests
- The contract should include scripts to drive it using either Bash and NEAR CLI or near-api-js in NodeJS files
